#### Behavioral Diagrams:
- **Use Case Diagram:**
  - Represents the interactions between a system and its external entities (actors) to achieve specific goals.
- **Sequence Diagram:**
  - Shows the interactions between objects over time, emphasizing the order of messages.
- **Activity Diagram:**
  - Models the dynamic aspects of a system, showing the flow of activities.
