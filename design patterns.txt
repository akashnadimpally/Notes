          this.subsystemB = new SubsystemB();
          this.subsystemC = new SubsystemC();
      }

      void operation() {
          subsystemA.operationA();
          subsystemB.operationB();
          subsystemC.operationC();
      }
  }
  ```

          // Implementation
      }
  }

  // Composite
  class Composite implements Component {
      private List<Component> children = new ArrayList<>();

      void add(Component component) {
          children.add(component);
      }

      @Override
      public void operation() {
          for (Component child : children) {
              child.operation();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 8. **Proxy Pattern:**

- **Definition:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
  
- **Key Components:**
  - Subject: Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy.
  - RealSubject: Represents the real object that the proxy represents.
  - Proxy: Controls access to the RealSubject.

- **Example (Java):**
  ```java
  // Subject
  interface Subject {
      void request();
  }

  // RealSubject
  class RealSubject implements Subject {

      }
  }

  // Proxy
  class Proxy implements Subject {
      private RealSubject realSubject;

      @Override
      public void request() {
          if (realSubject == null) {
              realSubject = new RealSubject();
          }
          // Additional logic (e.g., security checks, logging)
          realSubject.request();
      }
  }
  ```

### 9. **Decorator Pattern:**

- **Key Components:**


  - Component: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them.
  - ConcreteComponent: Implements the Component interface.
  - Decorator: Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.
  - ConcreteDecorator: Adds responsibilities to the component.

- **Example (Java):**
  ```java
  // Component
  interface Component {
      void operation();
  }

  // ConcreteComponent
  class ConcreteComponent implements Component {
      @Override
      public void operation() {
          // Implementation
      }
  }

  // Decorator
  abstract class Decorator implements Component {
      protected Component component;

      public Decorator(Component component) {
          this.component = component;
      }

      @Override
      public void operation() {
          component.operation();
      }
  }

  // ConcreteDecorator
  class ConcreteDecorator extends Decorator {
      public ConcreteDecorator(Component component) {
          super(component);
      }

      @Override
      public void operation() {
          super.operation();
          // Additional responsibilities
      }
  }
  ```

      }
  }
  ```

- **Observer Pattern Example:**
  ```java
  // Subject (Observable)
  public interface Subject {
      void addObserver(Observer observer);
      void removeObserver(Observer observer);
      void notifyObservers();
  }

  // Concrete Subject
  public class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
      private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

      @Override

      void update();
  }

  // Concrete Observer
  public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
      @Override
      public void update() {
          // Update logic
      }
  }
  ```

      void addObserver(Observer observer);
      void removeObserver(Observer observer);
      void notifyObservers();
  }

  // ConcreteSubject
  public class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
      private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

      @Override
      public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
          observers.add(observer);
      }

      @Override
      public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
          observers.remove(observer);
      }

      @Override
      public void notifyObservers() {
          for (Observer observer : observers) {
              observer.update();
          }
      }
  }

  // Observer
  public interface Observer {
      void update();
  }

  // ConcreteObserver

          this.command = command;
      }

      public void pressButton() {
          command.execute();
      }
  }
  ```

### 4. **State Pattern:**

- **Purpose:**
  - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

  public class ConcreteStateB implements State {
      @Override
      public void handle() {
          // State B behavior
      }
  }

  // Context
  public class Context {
      private State currentState;

      public void setState(State state) {
          currentState = state;
      }

      public void request() {
          currentState.handle();
      }
  }
  ```

      public void setSuccessor(Handler successor) {
          this.successor = successor;
      }

      public abstract void handleRequest(int request);
  }

  // ConcreteHandler
  public class ConcreteHandlerA extends Handler {
      @Override
      public void handleRequest(int request) {
          if (request < 10) {
              // Handle request
          } else if (successor != null) {
              successor.handleRequest(request);
          }
      }
  }

  // ConcreteHandler
  public class ConcreteHandlerB extends Handler {
      @Override
      public void handleRequest(int request) {
          if (request >= 10 && request < 20) {
              // Handle request
          } else if (successor != null) {
              successor.handleRequest(request);
          }
      }
  }

  // Client
  public class Client {
      private Handler handlerChain;

      public Client() {
          // Build the chain of handlers
          Handler handlerA = new ConcreteHandlerA();
          Handler handlerB = new ConcreteHandlerB();

          handlerA.setSuccessor(handlerB);
          handlerChain = handlerA;
      }

      public void makeRequest(int request) {
          handlerChain.handleRequest(request);
      }
  }
  ```

These detailed notes cover essential aspects of several behavioral design patterns, including the Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Command Pattern, State Pattern, and Chain of Responsibility Pattern. Understanding and applying these patterns can enhance the flexibility and maintainability of software systems by providing effective solutions to common design challenges





Anti-pattern

Anti-patterns are common solutions to recurring problems that turn out to be counterproductive or ineffective. They are often well-intentioned but result in negative consequences when applied.

-----------------

### 1. **MVC Pattern:**

#### **Overview:**
- **Definition:** MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components.
- **Components:**
  - **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic.
  - **View:** Displays the data to the user and handles user input.
  - **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input and updating the Model and View accordingly.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Modularity:** Separation of concerns enhances modularity.
  - **Maintainability:** Easier to modify or extend individual components.
  - **Reusability:** Models and Views can be reused in different contexts.

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**

#### **Overview:**
- **Principle:** Proposed by Bertrand Meyer, it states that a software entity (class, module, function) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Explanation:**
  - New functionality should be added through the creation of new classes or modules, rather than altering existing ones.
  - Existing code remains untouched, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Example:**
  - Use of interfaces and abstract classes to allow for adding new implementations without modifying existing code.

### 3. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**

#### **Overview:**
- **Principle:** Proposed by Robert C. Martin, it suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).
- **Explanation:**
  - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
  - Inversion of control (IoC) containers are often used to achieve DIP.
- **Example:**
  - Using dependency injection to provide dependencies to a class rather than having the class create its own dependencies.

### 4. **Composing Objects Principle:**

#### **Overview:**
- **Principle:** Emphasizes the use of composition over inheritance for code reuse and flexibility.
- **Explanation:**
  - Encourage building complex functionality by composing simpler objects, rather than inheriting from complex parent classes.
  - Improves flexibility and reduces the limitations imposed by inheritance.
- **Example:**
  - Favoring composition by creating objects that encapsulate specific behaviors and combining them to create more complex objects.

### 5. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**

#### **Overview:**
- **Principle:** States that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
- **Explanation:**
  - Large, monolithic interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones.
  - A class should only be required to implement the interfaces relevant to its functionality.
- **Example:**
  - Breaking down a general-purpose interface into several specific interfaces that clients can implement selectively.

### 6. **Principle of Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter):**

#### **Overview:**
- **Principle:** Also known as the Law of Demeter, it suggests that a class should have limited knowledge about other classes.
- **Explanation:**
  - A class should only communicate with its immediate neighbors (related classes or components), not with distant classes.
  - Reduces coupling and improves maintainability.
- **Example:**
  - Accessing properties or methods of objects directly passed as parameters, rather than reaching into the internals of these objects.

### 7. **Code Smells:**

#### **Overview:**
- **Definition:** Code smells are certain patterns or structures in code that may indicate a deeper problem.
- **Examples:**
  - **Duplicated Code:** Repeated sections of code, leading to maintenance challenges.
  - **Long Methods:** Large and complex methods that are hard to understand and maintain.
  - **Large Classes:** Classes with too many responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
  - **Primitive Obsession:** Using primitives where a dedicated class or enum would be more appropriate.
  - **Feature Envy:** A class that uses excessive queries and manipulations on another class.
- **Detection:**
  - Code reviews, static analysis tools, and regular refactoring can help identify and address code smells.

Understanding and applying these principles and practices contribute to the development of clean, maintainable, and scalable software systems. They provide guidance on structuring code, managing dependencies, and minimizing potential issues in software design and architecture.
